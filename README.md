# Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, we can conclude:

- The quantity and range of movie gets larger.We have more choices to choose from as an audience.
- We can not say high budget guarantees high popularity. But for movies with higher budgets do produce higher average popularity.
- To produce a more popular movie, the runtime should be best around 150 mins; Drama, Comedy, Action, these genres would be preferable.

# Limitations:
Apart from the factors that makes the movies popular and successful, limitations should also be considered. There are some missing data and many erroreous zeros which may affect the analysis.

- It's hard for us to know how the vote_counts and popularity are measured.
- For foreign movies,currency is not indicated. Inflation over the years should also be taken into consideration.
